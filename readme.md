# Chimera - Front-End Boilerplate


## About

Just a basic front-end boilerplate. I wasn't happy with available solutions, so I've played Dr Frankenstein a bit and built a little but growing monster of my own.


## Fratures

Chimera includes:

- Twitter Bootstrap
- FontAwesome
- jQuery
- ModernizrJS
- AngularJS
- Google Analytics
- Social Media metadata
- Favicon
- Apple Touch Icon

You're absolutely free to replace [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) with [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) or any other front-end framework. Also, you can replace [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) with [Fontelico](https://github.com/fontello/fontelico.font).

It's responsive, mobile-first and all assets used are up to date.
